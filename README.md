# 🧪 ht-nct-automation

This repository showcases a real-world QA automation demo inspired by my testing work at NCT (NhacCuaTui). It reflects both my hands-on manual experience and my transition into automation testing using **Appium + Python**.

## 🎧 1. Appium Project – Playlist Validation in NCT App (Android)

### 📋 Description
A Python + Appium test script simulating end-user behavior to:

- Swipe through a grid of dynamic playlists
- Detect and collect playlist titles dynamically
- Tap to open each playlist and verify its proper rendering
- Log missing, broken, or empty playlists for follow-up

### 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Uses `UiAutomator2`, `WebDriverWait`, and dynamic XPath selectors
- ✅ Implements swipe gestures to mimic real user interaction
- ✅ Reusable helper functions for grid navigation
- ✅ Designed from real production UI (reverse-engineered via inspection)

### 🧰 Technologies

- Python
- Appium
- Selenium WebDriver

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was created to:

- Demonstrate my ability to apply automation to real-world mobile testing
- Reflect a QA mindset: from UI behavior analysis to test logic design
- Serve as a technical extension of my CV when applying for QA Engineer roles
- Show my motivation to transition into full-stack automation testing
