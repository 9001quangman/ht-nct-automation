Dear Hiring Team at Coder Trove,

I'm writing to express my interest in the QA Tester position recently posted. With over 5 years of experience in manual testing across web, mobile, and OTT platforms — combined with my continuous learning in automation — I believe I’m well-aligned with the requirements of your team.

In my current role at NCT NhacCuaTui, I’ve designed and executed 500+ test cases for our music app, covering areas like livestream, download, and in-app purchase. My contributions have helped detect critical issues pre-release, including logic vulnerabilities and data loss scenarios. Beyond manual testing, I’ve proactively started integrating automation into my workflow. Notably, I built an Appium-based test script to dynamically validate playlist navigation in our Android app — from swiping across the UI to verifying playlist titles using `WebDriverWait` and XPath strategies.

I’ve also developed a small Cypress demo using Google Maps API to simulate real-world address validation — both projects are available on my GitHub. These efforts reflect not only my technical adaptability, but also my drive to improve testing efficiency in complex front-end systems.

I’m excited about the opportunity to work closely with the QA/Delivery Manager and contribute to a mix of FinTech and eCommerce projects. I value structured testing, clear communication, and learning from a collaborative team — all of which align well with Coder Trove’s environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I’d be happy to discuss how I can contribute to your QA efforts.

Best regards,

# QA Automation Demo – NCT Playlist Testing & Address Validation (Cypress + Appium)

This repository showcases two hands-on QA automation demos inspired by real-world projects:

## 🧪 1. Appium Project – Playlist Validation in NCT App (Android)

### Description
A Python + Appium test script simulating user behavior to:
- Swipe through a grid of playlists
- Detect dynamic playlist titles
- Open each playlist and verify its correct rendering
- Log missing or inaccessible playlists

### Key Features
- Uses `UiAutomator2`, `WebDriverWait`, and dynamic `XPath`
- Swipe gesture handling to mimic real user navigation
- Reusable helper methods for grid scrolling and playlist interaction
- Designed from scratch based on reverse-engineered UI elements

### Technologies
- Python
- Appium
- Selenium WebDriver

## 🌐 2. Cypress Project – Address Validation with Google Maps API

### Description
A Cypress end-to-end test simulating address input and verification:
- Auto-fill with Google Maps API
- UI validation for accepted/invalid addresses
- Screenshot on failure, report output for test runs

### Technologies
- Cypress
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- HTML/CSS demo frontend

---

## 🚀 Purpose

These projects were created to:
- Demonstrate real-world automation capability
- Reflect my QA mindset, from problem analysis to test design
- Complement my CV in applying for roles like QA Engineer at Coder Trove
